# MRSR
Manifold regularized self- representation(MRSR) algorithm is an effective unsupervised feature selection method which can preserve the local spatial structure by incorporating an effective manifold regularization into the objective function. An iterative reweighted least square (IRLS) algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem and the convergence is proved. 

For more details about the algorithm, please refer to the paper 'UNSUPERVISED FEATURE SELECTION BY MANIFOLD REGULARIZED SELF-REPRESENTATION'.
